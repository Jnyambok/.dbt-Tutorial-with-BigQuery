# dbt Project README

This README provides an overview of the dbt (data build tool) project.

## Project Description



## Project Contents

This project typically contains the following directories:

* `models`: Contains the SQL models that define your data transformations.
* `seeds`: Contains CSV files for static data that your models depend on.
* `macros`: Contains reusable SQL code snippets.
* `tests`: Contains tests to ensure the quality of your data and models.
* `snapshots`: Contains configurations for capturing point-in-time data for slowly changing dimensions.
* `analysis`: Contains SQL files for more complex queries and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, etc.)
* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip (Python package manager)
* Database connection details

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your dbt project:

1.  **Set up a virtual environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv dbt-core-demo
    cd dbt-core-demo
    source scripts/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # On Windows, use: .\scripts\activate
    ```
    This creates an isolated Python environment for your dbt project to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

2.  **Install dbt Core and a database adapter:**

    ```bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip # Ensure pip is up-to-date
    pip install dbt-core  # Install dbt Core
    pip install dbt-<your_database_adapter> # Install the adapter for your data warehouse (e.g., dbt-bigquery, dbt-snowflake, dbt-redshift)
    ```
    Replace `<your_database_adapter>` with the appropriate adapter for your database.  For example, if you are using BigQuery, you would use `pip install dbt-bigquery`.

3.  **Initialize the dbt project:**

    ```bash
    dbt init dbt_core_demo
    ```
    This command creates the basic dbt project structure in the `dbt_core_demo` directory.

4.  **Configure your dbt profile:**

    * Create a `profiles.yml` file in your `~/.dbt/` directory (or the appropriate location for your operating system).
    * Define a profile for your data warehouse connection.  See the dbt documentation for details: [https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile)

    Example `profiles.yml` (for BigQuery):

    ```yaml
    dbt_core_demo:  # Profile name (should match the name used in dbt_project.yml)
      target: dev     # Target name (e.g., dev, prod)
      outputs:
        dev:
          type: bigquery
          project: <your_gcp_project_id>
          dataset: <your_bigquery_dataset>
          threads: 1
          keyfile: <path_to_your_bigquery_credentials_json_file>
        prod: #Another target
          type: bigquery
          project: <your_prod_gcp_project_id>
          dataset: <your_prod_bigquery_dataset>
          threads: 4
          keyfile: <path_to_your_prod_bigquery_credentials_json_file>
    ```

## Usage

### Running the dbt Project

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <your_project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Run dbt:**

    * To run all models:

        ```bash
        dbt run
        ```
    * To select specific models:

        ```bash
        dbt run --select <model_name>
        dbt run --select <folder_name>+ # Run models in a folder and its subfolders
        ```
    * To test your models:

        ```bash
        dbt test
        ```
    * To generate documentation:

        ```bash
        dbt docs generate
        dbt docs serve
        ```

## dbt Commands Used (Based on Your Input)

Here are the dbt commands you've used, based on our conversation:
